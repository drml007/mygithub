# credit_underwriting_project
Based on the data that is available during loan application, build a model to predict default in the future. This will help the company in deciding whether or not to pass the loan.


This project was done as part of Imarticus certification excercise. It involved all phases of a Data Science project. It also included feature engineering which helped me to significantly reduce my model execution timings. All in all a good project to refer to when doing classification analysis using Logistic regression for Credit Risk projects.
